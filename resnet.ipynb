    "From experience, the depth of the network is crucial to the performance of the model. When the number of network layers is increased (increasing the depth), the network can extract more complex feature patterns, so theoretically, better results can be obtained when the model is deeper.\n",

Deep network optimization is very difficult, and there will be many problems occurring, such as the notorious problem of [vanishing/exploding gradients [2]](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.rev-doc.isae.fr/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=279181). While these problems has been almost solved by methods such as [Normalized Initialization [3]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01852.pdf) and [Batch Normalization [4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, experiments have found that when deeper networks are able to start converging, a degradation problem has been exposed. In other words, with the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be unsurprising) and then degrades rapidly. This phenomenon can be seen directly in Figure 1 from [paper[1]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) which shows the training error (left) and test error (right) on CIFAR-10 with 20-layer and 56-layer \"plain\" networks. The deeper network has higher training error, and thus the same for test error. This is not caused by overfitting, because the training error (left) of the 56-layer network is also higher than that of the 20-layer.\n",

    "As we see in the above plots, for all these three ResNets, they all have a common phenomenon: the validation loss might fluctuate or increase while minimizing the training loss. This is considered to be caused by overfitting to the training data, which can be solved by some methods practiced in our previous [deep learning courses](https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/deep-learning/tree/main/deep), such as: Early stopping, change of the optimizer, and Dropout. Due to limited time, we will not do more experiments about overfitting here, but you can try these methods after class if you want.\n",
