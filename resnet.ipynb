This phenomenon can be seen directly in Figure 1 which shows the training error (left) and test error (right) on CIFAR-10 with 20-layer and 56-layer \"plain\" networks. The deeper network has higher training error, and thus test error. This is not caused by overfitting, because the training error of the 56-layer network is also high.\n",
