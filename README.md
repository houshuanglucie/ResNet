#### ***Note***: 
Note that this notebook is fairly compute intensive and it might be better to [run in Google Colab]().**
If you use Colab, mind yourself to **add external folders** (especially solutions, img and data) to it, and change alter default hardware CPU to **GPU**: just follow `Edit` > `Notebook settings` or `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as Hardware accelerator.
