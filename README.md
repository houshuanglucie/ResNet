PyTorch implementation of "[Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition", Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

#### ***Note***: 
Note that this notebook is fairly compute intensive and it might be better to **[run in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true).**
If you use Colab, mind yourself to **add external folders** (especially solutions and img) to it, the data folder is not necessary to be added, because it can be downloaded by running the code cell in notebook. Then change alter default hardware CPU to **GPU**: just follow `Edit` > `Notebook settings` or `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` and select `GPU` as Hardware accelerator.
